- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

To be completely honest, I previously took a CS class in high school that used Java. In that class, we were taught to write everything using encapsulation from the beginning. As a result, this assignment actually made more sense to me than some of the previous assignments where we didn't use encapsulation. I do think I have a better understanding of why encapsulation is important though. It keeps your files organized and makes it easier to debug your code, because everything is separate and not messy.

To someone taking this course in the future, I would say to list out ahead of time what goes where. That way, you avoid making functions in different classes that basically do the exact same thing. It'll help keep your code from getting cluttered, and it'll make your life a lot easier. Other than that, I'd just give a general warning to make sure you actually debug your code. It's easy to miss something small when you're passing information between a bunch of different classes.
